# Spatial Transcriptomic Data Cell Segmentation with Baysor

## Introduction

In this project we aims at creating a baseline for cell segmentation on spatial transcriptomic data using [Baysor](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor). 

Baysor is a tool for performing cell segmentation on imaging-based spatial transcriptomics data. It optimizes segmentation considering the likelihood of transcriptional composition, size and shape of the cell. In this project we will introduce the whole process of installing Baysor, setting up environmment and using Baysor for cell segmentation in spatial transcriptomic dataset.

The data we used as example is the mouse brain spatial transcriptomic data provided by BGI... It contains totally `` records of spatial location with the specific gene expression at the spot.

After using Baysor to do the cell segmentation on the ST dataset, we also
